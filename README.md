# Brooks Builds Community GGEZ Crate

This project is by and for all of us Brooks Builds community members who are using GGEZ to learn how to program in Rust, and of course make some games. Brooks will be reviewing pull requests and issues regularly on his [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker). 

The origin story for this library is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). It can be daunting to begin contibuting to open source software, especially if we are new to a language or framework. This project is meant to be a jumping off point for beginners and veterans to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [GGEZ](https://ggez.rs/) alike get some pull requests in and get their t-shirt!

Are there GGEZ utility crates already? Of course there are. But this one is special as its by and for this community. We may be re-implementing some of the features that the other GGEZ libraries have but this is primarily a learning experience project. 

## Code of Conduct

We are using the Brooks Builds [code of conduct](https://github.com/brooks-builds/code_of_conduct).

## Contributing

There are many ways to contibute to this project. The easiest way is to submit and message on [issues](https://github.com/brooks-builds/bbggez/issues). We can't promise that we will implement every request that we get, but we can discuss why we want to go in a certain direction.

If you want to get involved and write some code then follow these steps to contribute.

It doesn't matter what level of developer you or how much Rust you know. If you want to pair with a community member please mention this in the comments and I can pair with you.

1. Find an issue that isn't currently being worked on that sounds interesting (there will be a comment stating that the developer is working on the issue if it is being worked on)
1. Write a comment stating that you're going to work on the issue
1. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions about the issue. It is possible that some issues won't have pull requests accepted as they don't match the direction that we want to go with the project.
1. Fork the repository
1. Clone the repository to your local environment
1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed
1. Run the tests with the command `cargo test` to make sure that everything is working as expected
1. Make your changes locally
1. Add tests for any code you write
1. Add documentation for any code you write
1. Run the tests again to make sure that the tests are still working
1. If you added or changed a feature add or change the appropriate example
1. Push your code to your GitHub account
1. Pull request your changes

If you are adding a pull request for Hacktoberfest, note that your pull request doesn't need to be accepted to get counted. Get that t-shirt!

We are more than happy to have documentation pull-requests, they are a great way to get started with open source.

## Using the Library

You can run an example to show how to use the library with the command `cargo run --example <example name>
